# Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Ultra (Customized for Shukti)

This is a personalized version of **FireRed Ultra**, for Shukti's birthday.

## Core Story Changes
*   **The Rival:** **STACEY** (Shukti's old boss). She's "very stupid" and makes lots of jokes about redundancies and poor business strategy. Her dialogue reflects her bossy persona and the closure of her hair salon.
*   **The Main Quest:** Team Rocket has stolen **Fig**, a special Shiny dog (Shiny Rockruff). NPCs in Mill Town and La-Vampire Town provide clues about her whereabouts.
*   **The Reward:** Upon defeating the Rocket boss in Silph Co., Shukti rescues Fig from the President and gets to keep her!
*   **Bowie (Pug):** A catchable wild "legendary" encounter in the Curl-ulean Gym. The Gym Leader, Bryony, has special dialogue if you catch or defeat him.
*   **The Final Boss:** The Champion is **OLLIE**. He features a powerhouse team of Gengar, Charizard, Gyarados, Raichu, Dragonite, and Snorlax.

## Completed Features
*   **Following Pokémon:** The first Pokémon in your party follows you!
*   **Forced Identity:** Name is forced to **SHUKTI**, Gender is forced to **Female**. Intro selection screens are skipped.
*   **Custom Starters:** Morpeko, Eevee, and Alolan Raichu (all with heavily buffed "Ultra" base stats).
*   **The "All Starters" Quest:** After choosing your first Pokémon, **Professor Tree** (renamed from Oak) will give you the remaining two starters later in the game:
    *   **Second Starter:** Speak to Professor Tree in the **Curl-ulean City** Pokémon Center.
    *   **Third Starter:** Speak to Professor Tree in the **Fo-Shear-ia City** Pokémon Center.
*   **Evolution Items:** Added **Fire, Water, Thunder, Leaf, Ice, Sun, Moon, Shiny, Dusk, and Dawn Stones** as pickup items scattered around Mill Town to allow early evolution for Eevee.
*   **Town Renames (Puns & References):**
