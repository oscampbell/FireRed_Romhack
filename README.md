# Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Ultra (Customized for Shukti)

This is a personalized version of **FireRed Ultra**, for Shukti's birthday.

## Core Story Changes
*   **The Rival:** **STACEY** (Shukti's old boss). She's "very stupid" and makes lots of jokes about redundancies and poor business strategy. Her dialogue reflects her bossy persona and the closure of her hair salon.
*   **The Main Quest:** Team Rocket has stolen **Fig**, a special Shiny dog (Shiny Rockruff). NPCs in Mill Town and York provide clues about her whereabouts.
*   **The Reward:** Upon defeating the Rocket boss in Silph Co., Shukti rescues Fig from the President and gets to keep her!
*   **Bowie (Pug):** A catchable wild "legendary" encounter in the Letchworth Gym. The Gym Leader, Bryony, has special dialogue if you catch or defeat him.
*   **The Final Boss:** The Champion is **OLLIE**. He features a powerhouse team of Gengar, Charizard, Gyarados, Raichu, Dragonite, and Snorlax.

## Completed Features
*   **Following Pokémon:** The first Pokémon in your party follows you!
*   **Forced Identity:** Name is forced to **SHUKTI**, Gender is forced to **Female**. Intro selection screens are skipped.
*   **Custom Starters:** Morpeko, Eevee, and Alolan Raichu (all with heavily buffed "Ultra" base stats).
*   **Town Renames:** Global UK-themed overhaul (Work in Progress).
*   **New NPCs:** Zaynab and Aliyah added to Mill Town with custom dialogue about Fig.
*   **Gym Guide (OLLIE):** The guy in every gym is now **OLLIE**. He acts as a loving, supportive partner giving genuine advice and romantic gifts in every gym.
*   **Secret Message:** A hidden message from Ollie on the NES in Shukti's room.

## Modified Gym Leader Teams
*   **Stevenage (Faris):** Ralts (Lv. 12), Kirlia (Lv. 14).
*   **Letchworth (Bryony):** Jigglypuff (Lv. 18), Jynx (Lv. 19), Mr. Mime (Lv. 19), Poliwhirl (Lv. 20), Flareon (Lv. 20), Vileplume (Lv. 21).
*   **Southampton (David):** Graveler (Lv. 21), Sudowoodo (Lv. 23), Golem (Lv. 24).
*   **Manchester (Bryony & Faris):** Espeon (Lv. 43), Sylveon (Lv. 43), Gardevoir (Lv. 44), Gallade (Lv. 44), Alakazam (Lv. 43).
