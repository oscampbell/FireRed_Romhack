# Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Ultra (Customized for Shukti)

This is a deeply personalized version of **FireRed Ultra**, created as a gift for Shukti.

*   **The Reward:** Upon defeating the Rocket boss in Silph Co., Shukti rescues Fig and gets to keep her!
*   **Bowie:** A legendary black dog (Houndoom) who can be found and caught in the Letchworth Gym.
*   **The Final Boss:** The Champion is **Ollie**, with a powerhouse team: Gengar, Charizard, Gyarados, Raichu, Dragonite, and Snorlax.
