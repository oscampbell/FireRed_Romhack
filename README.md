# Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Ultra (Customized for Shukti)

This is a personalized version of **FireRed Ultra**, for Shukti's birthday.

## Core Story Changes
*   **The Rival:** **STACEY** (Shukti's old boss). She's "very stupid" and makes lots of jokes about redundancies and poor business strategy. Her dialogue reflects her bossy persona and the closure of her hair salon.
*   **The Main Quest:** Team Rocket has stolen **Fig**, a special Shiny dog (Shiny Rockruff). NPCs in Mill Town and York provide clues about her whereabouts.
*   **The Reward:** Upon defeating the Rocket boss in Silph Co., Shukti rescues Fig from the President and gets to keep her!
*   **Bowie (Pug):** A catchable wild "legendary" encounter in the Letchworth Gym. The Gym Leader, Bryony, has special dialogue if you catch or defeat him.
*   **The Final Boss:** The Champion is **OLLIE**. He features a powerhouse team of Gengar, Charizard, Gyarados, Raichu, Dragonite, and Snorlax.

## Completed Features
*   **Following Pokémon:** The first Pokémon in your party follows you!
*   **Forced Identity:** Name is forced to **SHUKTI**, Gender is forced to **Female**. Intro selection screens are skipped.
*   **Custom Starters:** Morpeko, Eevee, and Alolan Raichu (all with heavily buffed "Ultra" base stats).
*   **Town Renames:** Global UK-themed overhaul:
    *   Pallet -> **Mill Town**
    *   Viridian -> **St Albans**
    *   Pewter -> **Stevenage**
    *   Cerulean -> **Letchworth**

    *   Cinnabar -> **Madeira**
    *   Indigo Plateau -> **Wembley**
*   **New NPCs:** Zaynab and Aliyah added to Mill Town with custom dialogue about Fig. Many more still to do, these 2 need a bigger role so will likely change, test worked.
*   **Gym Leader Overhaul:**
    *   Stevenage (Brock): **FARIS** (Psychic/Fairy Team: Ralts, Kirlia).
    *   Letchworth (Misty): **BRYONY** (Mixed Team: Jigglypuff, Jynx, Mr. Mime, Poliwhirl, Flareon, Vileplume). All other trainers removed.

    *   Manchester (Sabrina): **BRYONY & FARIS** (Double Battle! TEST)

    *   Birmingham: Destiny Knot
